## üöÄ More Coffee, Less XML

Compared to modern build tools, Java build tools feel outdated and overly complex. With **grind** we're trying to bring a similar experiance as very popular tools like `npm` and `cargo`.

**grind** is a blazing-fast, Rust powered command line interface designed to take the friction out of **Maven** and other Java Build tools. Tired of manually editing verbose `pom.xml` files or hunting for the right dependency version?

**grind** simplifies your project workflow by introducing the **`grind.yml`** manifest, providing a single, consistent source of truth for all your project configurations, Write less XML, manage more efficiently, and get back to writing code.

| Feature                      | Description                                                                                                     | CLI Example                          |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **‚òï Project Scaffolding**   | Quickly bootstrap a new Java project structure with a pre-configured `grind.yml` manifest.                      | `grind init my-new-service`          |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Config-Driven Builds**  | Builds the entire project based on the `grind.yml` manifest                                                     | `grind build`                        |
| **‚ûï Dependency Management** | Add and remove project dependencies directly from the command line without ever opening a `pom.xml` file again. | `grind add spring-boot mysql-driver` |
| **‚úÖ Task Execution**        | The `grind.yml` can contain many custom tasks, similar to `package.json`                                        | `grind task web`                     |

## üì• Installation

The **grind** CLI is distributed as a single, static binary built with Rust, meaning **no runtime dependencies** are needed‚Äîjust download and run!

We recommend downloading the appropriate binary for your system from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/anharhussainmiah/grind/releases/latest).

### Linux / macOS

1.  **Download the latest binary** (replace `X.Y.Z` with the actual version and adjust the file name for your OS/architecture):

    ```bash
    # For Linux (x86_64)
    wget -O cfe [https://github.com/anharhussainamiah/grind/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/cfe-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/cfe/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/cfe-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)

    # OR for macOS (Apple Silicon/M-series)
    wget -O cfe [https://github.com/anharhussainamiah/grind/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/cfe-aarch64-apple-darwin](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/cfe/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/cfe-aarch64-apple-darwin)
    ```

2.  **Make it executable**:
    ```bash
    chmod +x grind
    ```
3.  **Move it to your PATH** (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`):
    ```bash
    sudo mv grind /usr/local/bin/
    ```

### Windows (PowerShell)

1.  Download the `grind-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/anharhussainmiah/grind/releases/latest).
2.  Rename the downloaded file to `cfe.exe`.
3.  Place `grind.exe` in a directory included in your system's `Path` environment variable (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\.cargo\bin`).

## üí° Basic Usage Examples

Once installed, managing your Maven projects is only a single command away.

### 1. Initialize a New Project

Creates a new directory and project stucture, and the essential `grind.yml` manifest file.

```bash
# Creates a new directory named 'payments-api' and initializes files inside it
grind init payments-api
cd payments-api
```

## Output

```YAML
project:
  groupId: "com.example"
  artifactId: "payments-api"
  version: "1.0.0"
  name: "payments-api"
  description: ""

  dependencies:
    - groupId: "junit"
      artifactId: "junit"
      version: "4.13.2"
      scope: "test"

  tasks:
    clean: "rm -rf target/"
```

### 2. Build the Project

Runs the build process

```bash
grind build
```

### 3. Add Dependencies

Specify one or more dependencies to automatically insert them into your `pom.xml`.

```bash
grind add spring-boot-starter-web postgresql-driver
```

### 4. Remove Dependecnies

Remove dependencies just as easily.

```bash
grind remove postgresql-driver
```

### 5. Run the Project

Executes the project using the configured settings.

```bash
grind task run
```
